      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">For the past 10 years, whether working
        in universities in the US or with NGOs in Southeast Asia, I have always focused on what I can do to address the
        challenges my organizations or my communities faced. My driving question became "what problem do I want to solve
        in the world?"</p>
      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">I started coding, because I was curious. FreeCodeCamp popped onto
        my radar and I powered through the front end certification within 4 weeks. Months later, I had completed CS50,
        read a few You Don't Know JS books, and went through some Udemy courses. I was obsessed with learning more, and
        it was all so fun. It
        was probably somewhere in the middle of the night, after already a 10 hour day of coding, still excited about
        some problem I was trying to solve when I really began to think, maybe this is my next challenge?
      </p>
      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">I'm somewhat of an idealist and I hope to figure out how I can use
        what I've learned to make the world better.</p>
