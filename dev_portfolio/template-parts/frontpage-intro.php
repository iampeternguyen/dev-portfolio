      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">For the past 10 years, whether working
        in universities in the US or with NGOs in Southeast Asia, I have always focused on what I can do to address the
        challenges my organizations or my communities faced. My driving question became "what problem do I want to solve
        in the world?"</p>
      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">I started coding simply because I was curious. FreeCodeCamp popped
        onto
        my radar. I had no real understanding what a front end developer was, but I powered through the front end
        certification within 4 weeks. Months later, I had completed CS50,
        read a few You Don't Know JS books, and went through some Udemy courses. I was obsessed with learning more, and
        it was all so fun. One day, after a 12+ hour coding day, I realized I still was excited to keep going and that's
        when I decided that being a developer was for me.
      </p>
      <p class="intro__paragraph small margin bottom">With what I've learned so far, I want to work on projects that
        matter and that will hopefully make people's lives and the world better.</p>
